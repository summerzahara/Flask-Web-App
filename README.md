## Description:
This is a Flask App I created to store rental history in the cloud. For this project I used teh following tech stack:
- Flask
- TailwindCSS
- Postgresql 

My app has the following functionality:
- Landing Page
- About Page
- Ability to register with an account
- Ability to login with account
- Ability to add address information and store in database
- Ability to display stored information to the user

Project Setup:
- To start, I setup the project in VS Code
- I setup a virtual environment user Anaconda where I would install project dependencies (Flask, SQLAlchemy, psypg2 etc.)
- To start I created a basic "Hello World" app to ensure the flask app was working

Layouts:
- Next, I wanted to create a basic layout with a standard nav bar and footer that would appear on all pages
- I wanted to use Tailwind CSS, so I used npm to install CSS and configured the package.json and talwind.config.js files to point to the static folder where the css files would live
- I created a file called layout.html where I setup a responsive navbar and simple footer that would appear on all of the pages
- I used jinja so this could be extended to other pages
- To test, I made a simple landing page called index.html where i used jinja to extend the layout.html file

 Basic Login Functionality:
 - Next, I created a login.html file with a form where users could login
 - Here I used session to remember users upon login
 - I used jinja to display the username on the index.html file once users were logged in
 - I also created a logout button, which cleared the user session and redirected the user to the login page

 Registration Functionality:
 - Next I setup user registration
 - I created a register.html file with a form to allow users to register
 - I used werkzeug to create hashed password for the used
 - I created a file called models.py where I setup the database model for the user table
 - In the app.py file, I imported SQL Alchemy, and setup the connection to my local postgres database
 - When the flask app was run, the users table was created in the database
 - When users successfully register, the user information is stored in the database on the users table
 - I also setup flash messages to notify users whether registration was successful or an error occurred

 Adding Addresses:
 - Next, I setup the add address functionality
 - I created a addaddress.html file where I created a form for users to submit new addresses
 - I added a button on the index.html file so users could access the new form
 - I updated the models.py file with a new model for the addesses table, using the user id as the join to the user table
 - In the addaddress route in app.py, I validated a address was entered and added the new information to the database

Creating a dashboard:
- I created a new file called dashboard.html
- Here I moved the functionality from index.html with the add address button and logout button.
- In the dashboard route, I used a sqlquery using sqlalchemy to pull add addresses in the database for the user in session, and pass this to the html file
- Using jinja, I implemented a for loop to display the address fields for each address the user has stored on the dashboard

Landing Page & About Page:
- I redid the index.html file to be a basic landing page with an image
- I created a file called about.html with a description of the my webapp that was generated by ChatGPT
- I update all of the routes in app.py to make sure eveything was working as expected
